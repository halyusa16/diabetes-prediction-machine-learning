# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores health-related indicators to classify individuals into three categories:  
- **0:** No Diabetes  
- **1:** Prediabetes  
- **2:** Diabetes  

Various preprocessing steps such as handling imbalanced data (SMOTE, RandomUnderSampler), feature selection (RFE), and outlier removal (Z-score) were applied to improve model performance.

## Dataset
- **Name:** `diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv`
- **Description:** A dataset containing health indicators associated with diabetes classification. 

## 🛠️Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Handling)  
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **Imbalanced-learn** (SMOTE, RandomUnderSampler)  

## Project Steps
### 1️⃣ Data Loading  
- Read and explore the dataset.  
- Identify missing values and compute basic statistics.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized feature distributions.  
- Checked for class imbalance in target labels.  

### 3️⃣ Data Preprocessing 
- **Outlier detection & removal** using **Z-score**.  
- **Feature selection** with **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**.  
- **Class balancing** via **SMOTE (oversampling) & RandomUnderSampler (undersampling)**.  

### 4️⃣ Machine Learning Models 
Tested multiple models to compare their effectiveness:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Gradient Boosting**  
- **Decision Tree**  

### 5️⃣ Results & Insights 
- **Compared model performance** under different preprocessing techniques.  
- Assessed the impact of **feature selection** and **outlier removal** on accuracy.  

📌 **Evaluated using:**  
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with deep learning models.
